Hi - I'm Paige! ðŸŒ±

Iâ€™m currently at graduate student at Western Washington University and am new to coding!

I work as a TA for marine data analysis, if you're a student submitting your assignment - hello!

My current research is studying the tectonic geomorphology of oceanic transforms :) 

Here's a photo of my dog enjoying the sun:
